# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. _"Retrieval works"_ is an opinion. _"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"_ is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; _"80% seemed reasonable"_ does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**

The health-center and library-job questions each depend on information found
in only one document, so retrieval has no redundant source to recover from if
that chunk is missed. Allowing one miss accounts for this sparse coverage,
while missing more than one would indicate that retrieval is not reliably
finding answer-bearing chunks.

<!-- e.g. "One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so
     I expect that one to be hard." -->

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**

Source metadata is already attached to every retrieved chunk, so the system
can name a source for every answer based on those chunks. An answer without a
source cannot be independently verified, so there is no reason to allow any
of the five test answers to omit one.

<!-- Why all five and not four? What about your setup makes that achievable —
     or what would have to go wrong for it not to be? -->

---

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**

Embedding distance measures semantic similarity rather than whether a
document can actually answer a question. Some out-of-scope questions may
appear related to the health-center or computer-science documents, so one
false acceptance is possible; more than one would indicate that the relevance
threshold is not reliably separating unsupported questions.

<!-- What did your distances look like when you set the cutoff in Milestone 4?
     Was there a clean gap, or did the two groups overlap? -->

---

## 4. Preserve sentence boundaries

Neither the beginning nor the end of any chunk is in the middle of a sentence.

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know if your chunks were the right size? Name something
     countable or observable.

     Examples of the right shape — don't copy these, they should come from
     what you actually saw in Milestone 3:
       - "At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks read as a complete thought, with no
          sentence cut in half at either end."
       - "No chunk is shorter than 200 characters, since anything below that
          in my corpus turned out to be a heading with no content under it." -->

**Why this target:**

A sentence cut off in the middle may lose necessary context, making the retrieved evidence incomplete or misleading. Sentence boundaries are under the chunker's control and easy to verify, so there is no reason to allow any chunk to contain a truncated sentence.

---

## 5. Source-supported claims

For all five test answers, every factual claim must be supported by at least one source document cited in that answer.

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. It could be about
     speed, about refusals, about a particular kind of question your corpus
     handles badly, about source attribution being correct rather than merely
     present — anything, as long as it names a number or an observable
     outcome. -->

**Why this target:**

An unsupported factual claim is ungrounded and could mislead the user even
when a source is cited. Because grounded answers are a core requirement of
this system, allowing even one of the five test answers to include an
unsupported claim would violate the intended behavior.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
